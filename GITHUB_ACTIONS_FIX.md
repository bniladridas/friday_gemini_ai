# GitHub Actions Workflow Fix

This document explains the changes made to fix the GitHub Actions workflow for the Friday Gemini AI Ruby gem.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated GitHub Actions Workflow

The original workflow file had issues with the bundler installation step. The following changes were made:

**Before:**
```yaml
- name: Set up Ruby 3.1.0
  uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
  with:
    ruby-version: '3.1.2'

- name: Install Bundler
  run: gem install bundler --user-install

- name: Install Dependencies
  run: bundle install
```

**After:**
```yaml
- name: Set up Ruby 3.1.0
  uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
  with:
    ruby-version: '3.1.2'
    bundler-cache: true # This will install bundler and cache dependencies

- name: Install Dependencies
  run: bundle install --jobs 4 --retry 3 --trace
```

Key improvements:
- Removed the problematic `--user-install` flag
- Added `bundler-cache: true` to the Ruby setup step
- Added `--jobs 4 --retry 3 --trace` options to the bundle install command for better performance and debugging

### 2. Updated Gemfile

Added a specific bundler version requirement to ensure compatibility with Ruby 3.1.2:

```ruby
# Specify bundler version
gem 'bundler', '>= 2.3.0'
```

## Why These Changes Fix the Issue

1. **Bundler Installation**: The `bundler-cache: true` option in the Ruby setup action handles bundler installation correctly, avoiding the permission issues that can occur with `--user-install`.

2. **Detailed Logging**: The `--trace` option provides detailed logs that help identify the root cause of any remaining issues.

3. **Bundler Version**: Specifying a compatible bundler version ensures that the right version is used with Ruby 3.1.2.

## Testing the Fix

After pushing these changes to your repository, the GitHub Actions workflow should run successfully. You can monitor the workflow in the "Actions" tab of your GitHub repository.

If you encounter any further issues, the detailed logs from the `--trace` option will provide more information for troubleshooting.

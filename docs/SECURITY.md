## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities very seriously. If you discover a security issue in our codebase, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

### Private Disclosure Process

**IMPORTANT**: Do not report security issues through public GitHub issues, discussions, or other public channels.

Please report security issues by creating a new security advisory in our GitHub repository. This ensures proper tracking and handling of security reports.

### What to Include in Your Report

To help us triage and fix the issue, please include the following information:

1. **Project Information**
   - Affected component/package
   - Version number(s) affected
   - Environment details (OS, Ruby version, etc.)

2. **Vulnerability Details**
   - Type of vulnerability (XSS, CSRF, RCE, etc.)
   - Step-by-step instructions to reproduce
   - Impact of the vulnerability
   - Any potential workarounds

3. **Additional Context**
   - Proof of concept (if available)
   - Suggested fixes or mitigation strategies
   - Any related CVEs or references

### Our Security Process

1. **Initial Response**
   - We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
   - We will assign a severity level based on CVSS scoring

2. **Investigation**
   - Our security team will investigate the report
   - We may request additional information

3. **Resolution**
   - We will develop and test a fix
   - The fix will be released according to our severity-based timeline

### Response Timelines

| Severity | Initial Response | Fix Release | Public Disclosure |
|----------|------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Critical | 24 hours | 1-3 days | After patch available |
| High     | 48 hours | 1-2 weeks | After patch available |
| Medium   | 72 hours | Next release | Next release notes |
| Low      | 5 days   | Next release | Next release notes |

### Security Updates

Security updates are typically released as patch versions (e.g., 1.2.3 â†’ 1.2.4). We recommend always using the latest patch version of your chosen minor version.

### Security Best Practices

1. **Dependencies**
   - Keep all dependencies up to date
   - Use `bundle audit` to check for vulnerable dependencies
   - Enable Dependabot for automated dependency updates

2. **Configuration**
   - Use environment variables for sensitive data
   - Follow the principle of least privilege
   - Enable all available security features

3. **Development**
   - Run security scanners as part of your CI/CD pipeline
   - Perform regular security audits
   - Follow secure coding practices

### Recognition

We believe in giving credit where it's due. Security researchers who report valid vulnerabilities will be:
- Thanked in our release notes (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- Listed in our SECURITY.md file (if you wish)
- Eligible for our Security Hall of Fame

   - Implement rate limiting for API calls

### For Developers

1. **Code Security**
   - Follow secure coding practices
   - Validate all inputs
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Implement proper error handling

2. **Dependencies**
   - Regularly update dependencies
